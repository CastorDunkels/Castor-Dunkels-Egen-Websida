          <h1>Bloodborne</h1>

          <h3>
            Bloodborne is a spiritual sequel to the critically acclaimed Demon's Souls. The original game's appeal lay with its renowned difficulty and trial-and-error approach, one that Bloodborne promises to sustain and improve on.
          </h3>

          <p>
            Bloodborne is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, which was released for the PlayStation 4 in March 2015.
            Development began in 2012 under the working title of Project Beast. Bearing many similarities to the Souls series of games by the same developer and director, Bloodborne was inspired by the literary works of authors H. P. Lovecraft and Bram Stoker and the architectural design of real-world locations in countries such as Romania, the Czech Republic and Scotland.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bloodborne received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its gameplay, particularly its high difficulty level, atmosphere, sound design, Lovecraftian themes, and interconnected world design.
            Bloodborne has won several awards and has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. Some related media and adaptations have also been released, including a card game, board game and comic book series. By the end of 2015, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide. 
            Some criticism was directed at its technical performance at launch, which was improved with post-release updates.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bloodborne's soundtrack was composed by a mix of Japanese and Western composers. The soundtrack contains over 80 minutes of original music by Tsukasa Saitoh, Yuka Kitamura, Nobuyoshi Suzuki, Ryan Amon, Cris Velasco and Michael Wandmacher and features performances by a 65-piece orchestra and a 32-member choir.
