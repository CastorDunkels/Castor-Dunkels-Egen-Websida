          <h1>Story</h1>

          <p>The player character, a Hunter, sees that an old man is operating on them. The man explains that he is performing a blood transfusion to allow the player to sign a "contract", and mentions a mysterious condition referred to as Paleblood. He warns the Hunter that they will go on a strange journey that may seem like a bad dream. The screen goes dark, then returns to the operating table as a large, flesh-torn beast rises from the floor and extends a claw towards the immobile Hunter. Suddenly fire appears and forces the beast's retreat; little creatures ("Messengers") begin to crawl over the Hunter, and the screen then cuts to black. After the player completes character creation, the Hunter awakens on an operating table in a different clinic in Yharnam.</p>
          <p>Shortly after their arrival, the player finds their first lantern, which, when lit, transports them to a spectral realm called the Hunter's Dream. The player encounters two non-player characters: Gehrman, an elderly man who uses a wheelchair, provides advice, and the Doll, a life-sized living doll that assists the player in levelling up. Gehrman informs the player that to obtain the blood they seek and escape the dream, they must hunt down the beasts plaguing Yharnam and halt the source of the plague.</p>
          <p>While travelling through Central Yharnam, the second area, another non-player character tells the Hunter to seek out the Healing Church because of their connection to blood ministration, which is linked to the plague. The player encounters a hunter named Father Gascoigne, who seeks to kill the player to prevent them from transforming into a beast, but transforms into a monster himself midway through the fight. The Hunter moves through to the Cathedral Ward and enters the Grand Cathedral and encounters Vicar Amelia, now a massive beast. The Hunter comes into contact with an artefact that bids them to visit a place called Byrgenwerth, only accessible through a perilous area known as the Forbidden Woods. Arriving at Byrgenwerth after defeating three enemies known as the Shadows of Yharnam, the Hunter slays Rom, a cosmic kin. With Rom's death, the Hunter gains access to a higher degree of perception and sees Queen Yharnam, an ancient being from the dead civilization who supposedly bore Mergo, the source of the Nightmare. With their new perception, the Hunter can venture to the previously hidden village of Yahar'gul, where the now-visible Great Ones reside to be researched and worshipped by the School of Mensis. The scholars sought to build a vessel for a Great One, known as The One Reborn. After defeating it, the player accesses the spectral realm called the Nightmare of Mensis, where they discover the insane head of the scholars, Micolash. After killing him, the player encounters Mergo and its guardian, referred to as Mergo's Wet Nurse. After slaying Mergo's Wet Nurse and letting Mergo die, the game's final phase is initiated. When the Hunter returns to the Hunter's Dream, Gehrman offers to free the player from the dream and return them to the waking world in the morning.</p>
          <p>At this point, three different endings are possible depending on the player's actions. Choosing to accept Gehrman's offer results in the Yharnam Sunrise ending: Gehrman uses his scythe to behead the player, who awakens in Yharnam as the sun rises; in the Hunter's Dream, the Doll bids the Hunter farewell and prays that they live happily, having escaped the Nightmare. Declining Gehrman's offer unlocks one of two endings. The second ending, Honoring Wishes, is the default ending for this case: to prevent the Hunter from being trapped in the dream, Gehrman battles the player. After Gehrman is defeated, a Great One known as the Moon Presence arrives and embraces the player, binding them to the Hunter's Dream. The Doll is next seen pushing the player, now sitting in Gehrman's wheelchair, back to the workshop in the Hunter's Dream. The Doll remarks that a new Hunt will begin, signifying that the player has taken Gehrman's place as the caretaker of the Dream. Throughout the game, the player can find retrievable objects, thirds of an umbilical cord that forms when a Great One is trying to reproduce with a human as a surrogate. If the player consumes three Thirds of an Umbilical Cord before refusing Gehrman's offer, the Childhood's Beginning ending is unlocked. After Gehrman is defeated, the Moon Presence arrives to bind the player to the dream, but the player resists and fights the Presence in a final battle. Upon defeating the Moon Presence, the player is transformed into an infant Great One and is taken by the Doll.</p>
